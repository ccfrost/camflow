# Copy this file to your config location (e.g., on macOS at

## Local paths.

### Paths for photos.
#
# 1. Import destination: Where photos from the camera land for curation when importing from SD card.
#    Structure: date-based subfolders (YYYY/MM/DD/).
photos_to_process_root = "/Users/you/Google Drive/My Drive/media/photos/process_queue"
#
# 2. Upload source: Where you place curated+edited files ready for upload.
#    Structure: Flat (all files directly in this folder).
#    Note: this is not in Google Drive, because a bug in macOS+Google Drive
#          causes file loss.
photos_export_queue_dir = "/Users/you/Pictures/camflow_photos_queue_export"
#
# 3. Archive: Where photos are moved after upload.
#    Structure: date-based subfolders (YYYY/MM/DD/).
photos_exported_root = "/Users/you/Google Drive/My Drive/media/photos/exported"

### Paths for videos.
#
# Videos skip the process queue during import and go straight to the export queue.
#
# 1. Upload source: Videos waiting to be uploaded.
#    Structure: Flat (all files directly in this folder).
#    Note: this is not in Google Drive, because a bug in macOS+Google Drive
#          causes file loss.
videos_export_queue_root = "/Users/you/Pictures/camflow_videos_queue_export"
#
# 2. Archive: Where videos are moved after upload (or marking as exported).
#    Structure: date-based subfolders (YYYY/MM/DD/).
videos_exported_root = "/Users/you/Google Drive/My Drive/media/videos/exported"
